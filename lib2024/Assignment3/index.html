<h1>Introducing the adorable Cockapoo!</h1>

	

<h2> Some basic information about the Cockapoo</h2>

<p>"Intelligent and easy to please, the Cockapoo was established as a companion dog. He's friendly and happy, happy, happy. He has an outgoing nature and usually gets along with everyone. Depending on his temperament, he can be active or he can simply enjoy snuggling up on the couch with you."</p>

<p> "An adorable, small dog with the personality of a big clown, the Cockapoo is perhaps the first of the “designer dogs” (not a purebred dog breed), dating back to the 1960s, rather than to just a few years ago." (dogtime.com) </p>
